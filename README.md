## What is javascript control flow?
Javascript control flow is the order in which the conputer executes sttements in a script. The script uses a conditional structure or if... else. This is so that the different code executes depending on if the form is complete or not. 
## An example of this code would be:

if (field==empty) {
    promptUser();
} else {
    submitForm();
}

A typical script in JavaScript or PHP (and the like) includes many control structures, including conditionals, loops and functions. Parts of a script may also be set to execute when events occur.
